# Hospital Operational Efficiency Analysis 🏥

## 📌 Project Overview
An end-to-end data analysis project using **SQL Server** to identify bottlenecks in hospital operations, analyze staffing efficiency, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve patient satisfaction.

## 🛠️ Data Life Cycle Phases
I followed the **Google Data Analytics** methodology:
* **Ask:** Identified the core issue of high patient rejection rates in the Emergency department.
* **Prepare:** Gathered data from patients, services, and staff schedules.
* **Process:** Cleaned data using `TRIM`, handled date errors, and performed **Feature Engineering** to create the `Stay_Duration` metric.
* **Analyze:** Performed complex joins to calculate `patients_per_staff` and identify congestion points.
* **Share:** Documented findings in a structured SQL notebook with visual results.
* **Act:** Provided strategic recommendations for resource allocation.

## 📊 Key Insights
* **Emergency Crisis:** The Emergency department rejects over 1.3M patients due to capacity limits.
* **Staffing Gaps:** Identified high workload (43 patients/staff) in General Medicine, affecting morale.
